# Welcome on my Github space (@flodup)

### 🙋‍♂️ About me & what I'm looking for here ?
I'm a self-taught programmer in web and systems application domains. I love to build system chains, web apps and season it with a bit of automation.
I work with severals languages such as **Golang, C, Python or Typescript/Javascript** and technologies like **Ansible, GitLab CI, Docker or Nginx/Traefik** 

Some reasons pushed me to maintain a personal Github space, almost for same reason than people majority like sharing but also to discover, study and gain skills ever and ever.

I'm also a plant lovers and always happy to share tips on gardening and harvesting 🌳 🍓 🍠

### 🌱 What Am I working on or learning ?
I tend to essentially work on web technologies and systems building to found the best compromise between trivial and complex in opposition of bloated and complicated. I efforce myself to follow the well-know KISS philosophy as much I can.

I worked on many things like a [x86 Master Boot Record](https://github.com/flodup/seed-bootloader) or funny toys like [this web application](https://github.com/flodup/triplet)

My spare time is filled too with self-hosted servers with containerization trying to build a little homemade [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service)

For the self-learning languages and technologies part, I jump on every language that seems interesting in matter of robustness or efficiency such as [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and some designing with [HTML5/CSS3 buddies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

### 💗 Which domain I want to work or collaborate in
Rather than a heavy markdown text block, here's a list of domains that I will love to work in:
+ Web applications and services to improves others productivity
+ IoT for ecology and energy application
+ Computer systems (OS, kernels, etc...)

### 📬 How to reach me ?
You can actually contact me on [fdgd@flodup.dev](mailto:fdgd@flodup.dev) or this Github space directly as you please.
More communication channels are coming!

### ✍️ Writing
I write some programming and web/system technologies bills on my [blog](https://flodup.github.io/), don't forget to visit it!
