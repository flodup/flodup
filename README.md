# Welcome on my Github space (@flodup)

### 👀 About me & what I'm looking for here ?
I'm a self-taught programmer for almost 10 years when writing theses lines. I came in order with C, C++, Python, Assembly, Golang and started Rust a couple of days.
I never engaged real personnal projects but always programming for myself (on not being less complex subjects) with the aim to learn & practise a lot.
I love to resolve or transpose human problems in a computer way.

But now, I feel ready to begin and share something with the Open Source community to prove myself that I can carry on some projects to be released and re-used by 
others.

I'm not new to Github and git versioning system, as I'm currently an employee programmer for web backend & microservices, but this time I feel ready to
share my experience, programming POV and heart subjects.

### 🌱 What Am I working on or learning ?
Today, I tend to start a very challenging C project to dive in the complex subject of "How are designed operating systems?". I know most of people can be surprised
by this, saying to themselves: "This guy cames out of nowhere with an empty portfolio and he wants to 'lay' an OS ?".

Yup, but as I said before, this is not because a person never expose his work to the world that he/she has 0 competences. You may be good at drawing but never had 
exposed your art in a public gallery, many reasons for that.

I actually start my journey to dive in bootloaders design, writing a light standard x86 bootloader called [Seed](https://github.com/flodup/seed-bootloader), so wish me luck!

Currently, I started to learn the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), with a very interesting way to make safe programs (Ownership). But it requires a lot 
of practising time that I can't allocate for now, focused on my project.

### 💞️ Which domain I want to work or collaborate in
Rather than a heavy markdown text block, here's a list of domains that I will love to work in:
+ Embedded systems
+ IoT for ecology and energy application
+ Computer systems (OS, kernels, etc...)

### 📫 How to reach me ?
You can actually contact me on [f.dupont.dev@gmail.com](mailto:f.dupont.dev@gmail.com) or on Github directly.
More communication channels are coming!
